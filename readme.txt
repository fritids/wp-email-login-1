== Description ==

Lets you use your email address to log into your WordPress account instead of a username.

Since email addresses are required to be unique within WordPress anyway, they also make good identifiers for logging in.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload `/wp-email-login/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Log out, log in again using the email address associated with your WordPress account.
